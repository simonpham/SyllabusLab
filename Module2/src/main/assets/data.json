You can not just use one instead another without calling `toObservable()` or `toSingle()`. Also, it means that if your code was returning `Single` and then you've decided to change it to `Observable` or vice versa it'll require a non-zero amount of changes across the project.\n* Almost every combining operator applied to `Single` will convert it to `Observable`.
